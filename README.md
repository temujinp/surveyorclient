# surveyorclient

The project was originally done in netbeans 8 using :
Maven for dependency management
Spring 4 as root stack.

Did testing in Glassfish 4 which comes default with Netbeans.

Simply pull from this and then do build and run.

There is much still to be added and is not a reflection of best practice yet, it just offers as a sample experimental project.

Notice that on the login page there is a tabulated list of users login details to show the permission aspect of the app.
It is just a mockup and must still connect to a Rest Web Service.
